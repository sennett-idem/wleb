<h2>Improving Water Quality</h2>
<p>Indiana is working with landowners in our communities to help improve the water quality of our streams, rivers, and lakes, and ultimately Lake Erie. There are many groups including the <a href="http://www.in.gov/isda/2342.htm">Indiana State Department of Agriculture</a> partnering on several projects that result in significant measureable load reductions in sediment, nitrogen and total phosphorus in the Lake Erie Basin through education, promotion, development and installation of voluntary water quality programs and best management practice (BMP) implementation.</p>
</div>
<div id="action-and-milestone-table" class="section level2">
<h2>Action and Milestone Table</h2>
<p>The action and milestone table is a function of the Domestic Action Plan and tracks the progress of the partner groups on their commitments listed in the DAP.</p>
<p>The Action and Milestone Table is broken up into several sections including restoring natural hydrology and ecology function, urban point and nonpoint sources, rural point and nonpoint sources, education and outreach, and monitoring. The following tables contain partner updates, schedules, and accomplishments for the projects.</p>

<h2>Conservation Efforts</h2>
<p>Voluntary conservation efforts made by private landowners in Indiana, with support provided by the <a href="http://icp.iaswcd.org/">Indiana Conservation Partnership (ICP)</a>, have contributed significantly to the efforts to reduce sediment and nutrients from entering Indiana’s tributaries and rivers. The top conservation practices implemented by landowners that contribute to these reductions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cover Crops</li>
<li>Conservation Cover</li>
<li>Residue and Tillage Management, No-Till</li>
<li>Tree/Shrub Establishment</li>
</ul>
<p>Conservation programs that are used by private landowners include the ISDA <a href="https://www.in.gov/isda/divisions/soil-conservation/clean-water-indiana/">Clean Water Indiana (CWI)</a> Program, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources’ (IDNR) <a href="http://www.in.gov/dnr/fishwild/2364.htm">Lake and River Enhancement (LARE)</a> Program, as well as federally funded programs through EPA’s <a href="https://www.in.gov/idem/nps/funding/clean-water-act-section-319h-grants/">Section-319 Program</a> administered by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM), and the USDA’s Farm Bill Programs like the <a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/programs/financial/eqip/">Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP)</a>, the <a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2015/01/16/rcpp-help-improve-water-quality-lake-erie-other-american-waterbodies">Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP)</a>, the <a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detailfull/national/programs/?&amp;cid=nrcsdev11_023903">Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI)</a> Program, the <a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/in/programs/easements/acep/STELPRDB1248149/">Wetlands Reserve Easement Program (WREP)</a>, the <a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/programs/financial/csp/">Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP)</a>, and the <a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/conservation-programs/conservation-reserve-program/index">Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)</a>.</p>

<div id="soil-health" class="section level2">
<h2>Soil Health</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/soils/health/">Soil Health</a>, also referred to as soil quality, is defined as the continued capacity of soil to function as a vital living ecosystem that sustains plants, animals, and humans. Soil contains living organisms that when provided the basic necessities of life - food, shelter, and water – perform functions required to produce food, fuel and fiber. (USDA, NRCS)</p>
<p>Soil Health has four key principles for all types of lands:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimize Disturbance</li>
<li>Optimize Soil Cover</li>
<li>Optimize Biodiversity</li>
<li>Provide Continuous Living Roots</li>
</ul>
<p>By improving the health of the soil, it can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase organic matter</li>
<li>Increase aggregate stability</li>
<li>Increase water infiltration</li>
<li>Increase water-holding capacity</li>
<li>Improve nutrient use efficiency</li>
<li>Enhance and diversify soil biology</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most wide-scale and effective efforts in Indiana on water quality improvement is the education and promotion of soil health systems and conservation cropping systems in agriculture. The members of the <a href="http://icp.iaswcd.org/">Indiana Conservation Partnership (ICP)</a> are actively promoting a total conservation cropping systems approach to farming, including the education, training and outreach provided by the <a href="http://ccsin.iaswcd.org/">Conservation Cropping System Initiative (CCSI)</a>. This focus on soil health and function ultimately addresses Indiana’s primary natural resource concerns. Soil health practices include conservation tillage, using cover crops, adaptive nutrient management, integrated weed and pest management, diverse crop rotations, precision farming technology and prescriptive buffers. Soil Health is the Goal!</p>
<p>Conservation Tillage Practices, such as no-till, strip-till, ridge till and mulch till, are practices that leave crop residues on the soil surface to reduce soil erosion by water. Cover Crops are grown between regular cash crops like corn and soybeans to ensure a living root is growing all year long. Cover crops reduce soil compaction; they cover the soil and protect it from erosion; improve soil structure; increase soil organic matter; fix nitrogen and scavenge nitrogen depending on the species of cover crop used; and can produce forage or pasture.</p>
<p>To measure the impacts and trend of conservation tillage, Indiana begin a Tillage Transect in the spring of 1990, which is a predetermined route and on-the-ground survey, that measures the amount of residue left on the ground after planting. The ICP introduced a cover crop assessment to the spring transect in 2011. In 2014, a Fall Tillage and Cover Crop Transect was initiated. The information here shows results of the most recent reports and maps from the transect data within the Basin. For more information, visit the <a href="https://www.in.gov/isda/divisions/soil-conservation/cover-crop-and-tillage-transect-data/">Cover Crop and Tillage Transect Data page</a>.</p>

<h3>4Rs Nutrient Stewardship Program</h3>
<p>To help solve the problem of excess nutrients in our waters, the <a href="http://4rcertified.org/">4R Nutrient Stewardship Certification Program</a> was created and launched in March 2014. The certification program is composed of a set of science-based standards developed with industry and academic assistance which allow nutrient service providers a chance to follow standard recommendations that are third-party auditable. This is done to insure the standards are being followed when fertilizer recommendations are given to farmers. This program encourages agricultural nutrient service providers to adopt proven practices through the 4Rs – the Right Source, Right Rate, Right Time, and Right Place. In the Western Lake Erie Basin, there is one certified 4R retailer – click on the point on the map to learn more.</p>
